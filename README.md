# Flag Challenge
The purpose is to figure out 
1) how to decode a str (becomes a URL)
2) use the str to get instructions for the next challenge
3) parse an HTML doc to get another URL (the flag which is a word)
4) create a react app which will display the word in a typewriter format

The current react app that functions is under animjs
Soon I will be adding a typescript version under animts (currently an empty react app scaffolding)
